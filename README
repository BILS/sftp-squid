SFTP-Squid - CLI for transferring files between sftp servers
---

Currently some tests have been made.

test.py - paramiko test, get half of transferspeed of scp
test.pl - perl ssh2 test, better performance by a lot, but the api is just a
          thin wrapper around C

Location of ssh-keys are hardcoded in these files.
