SFTP-Squid - CLI for transferring files between sftp servers
---

Currently some tests have been made.

test.py      - paramiko test, get half of transferspeed of scp
test.pl      - perl ssh2 test, better performance by a lot, but the api is just a
               thin wrapper around C
test.go      - Go test program
test_scp.sh  - Testing with scp
test_sftp.sh - Testing with sftp
Sftp.java    - Testing java jsch library (http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/)

Location of ssh-keys are hardcoded in these files.
