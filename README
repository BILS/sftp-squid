SFTP-Squid - CLI for transferring files between sftp servers
---


Tests are in tests directory.

Currently some tests have been made.

test.py      - paramiko test
test.pl      - perl ssh2 test
test.go      - Go test program
test_scp.sh  - Testing with scp
test_sftp.sh - Testing with sftp
Sftp.java    - Testing java jsch library (http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/)

Location of ssh-keys and/or passwords are hardcoded in these files.

Timings:

scp     13.9    15.1    14.9    14.7    14.5
sftp    18.2    16.1    17.2    19.4    22.3
python  28.8    27.0    29.0    26.9    27.2
perl    44.2    24.2    20.4    19.4    22.4
Go      22.5    19.8    22.6    19.0    22.6
Go(c)   19.7    23.5    20.5    20.8    19.4
Java    13.0    13.1    13.1    13.0    13.1
SSHj    18.8    20.5    22.4    22.1    17.1
SSHj-j  14.9    13.7    14.9    13.4    14.9


The java library seems to be faster than even the scp and sftp programs. The
upload halts sometimes on large uploads, for no apparent reason (the c.rwsize
in Session.java of JSch turns to zero and never gets incremented (like it
normally is)).

Gonna try a different Java library.
